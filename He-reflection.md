*I was most confused by the "merging" branches.*
*During the GPS, I became more clear about the concepts behind merging*
*I asked them the significance of "fetch" and "merge" and in the real world which one do people use more often*
*I still need to do some reading and practice for a few more times in order to fully digest the operations surrounding merging*
*Pretty good. I became a little bit more comfortable when it comes to cooperation through video calls. And the bonus was I've done the GPS with two pretty girls.
